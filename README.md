Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
Overview
Fake news detection is a popular application of machine learning aimed at identifying misleading or false information, especially on social media platforms and news websites. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to classify news articles as "fake" or "real" based on their textual content. By analyzing text data, we can build models that detect deceptive patterns, enabling automated filtering of unreliable content.

Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
Datasets: Use datasets containing labeled news articles, such as the Fake News Dataset from Kaggle or the LIAR dataset, which includes statements labeled as "true" or "false."
Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing irrelevant symbols, special characters, stop words, and by standardizing text (e.g., converting to lowercase).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Text Analysis: Understand word frequency, commonly used words in fake vs. real news, and distributions of various features in the text.
Visualization: Create plots like word clouds and histograms to reveal patterns between fake and real news.
3. Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: Convert text into tokens (individual words).
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base forms to minimize redundancy.
Vectorization: Use methods like TF-IDF or Bag of Words to convert text into numerical form.
4. Model Selection and Training
Algorithms: Commonly used algorithms include:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for more advanced NLP models.
Training: Split the data into training and testing sets to build and evaluate model performance.
5. Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Measures overall correctness but may not reflect performance well if classes are imbalanced.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Provide insights into how well the model performs in detecting fake news versus real news.
Confusion Matrix: Shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
